Just DNA-Seq is a set of opensource libraries and pipelines designed to help everybody to:
* annotate your own genome with known longevity and health information with [OpenCravat plugins](https://github.com/dna-seq/opencravat-longevity)
* realign your genome and do variant calling with the latest tools using [Bioinformatic pipelines](https://github.com/dna-seq/dna-seq)
* get transparent opensource polygenic health risk predictions (work only started)

## Why Just DNA-Seq? ##

First human genome sequencing happened two decades ago and cost around 3 bln $. 
Today it turned from a great human endeavor to something that is accessible to all of us, and costs roughly 400-800 dollars.

So why bother with the DIY approach when there are a lot of personal genomics services out there already?

For us, the main concerns are the lack of transparency, privacy and, most importantly, room for customization - content of reports is decided by service, your choice is limited with their product line. Results such services deliver are based on proprietary databases and algorithms. While having large analysis departments and a lot of medical data to base conclusions upon, their analysis is not transparent at all, in many cases you have no idea why they made this or that prediction. Verifying or comparing their results is therefore troublesome, especially when you get totally different predictions from many companies.
More to that, what if we want to see how well our genes align with the prospect of longevity? For example, it is known that surviving until 90 years is more about lifestyle choices while living longer depends more on the genetics, people with exceptional longevity are not distinct in terms of lifestyle factors from the general population [[PMID: 21812767](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-5415.2011.03498.x)]. Unfortunately, there are simply no commercial offerings to address that demand.

At the same time, all the information necessary to do your own analysis is out there, lying in the open generously shared by the scientific community. 
So, why not use existing open source solutions developed by large academic groups then? 
Well, no luck here either! 

We looked through the existing ones and found out there are no tools to cover one topic very close to our hearts: genetics of longevity. 

Thatâ€™s when DNA-Seq comes into play!
